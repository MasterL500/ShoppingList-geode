# Shopping List (GEODE MOD)

Geomde-exclusive mod where you can see the amount of Items you have bought (or haven't bought yet) from the five available shops in the game Geometry Dash.

## Options

* **Disable Checkmark**: Icons aren't greyed out and displayed without the checkmark, if you want to see all the designs. This option is disabled by default.

## Developer comments

* I have no idea what am I doing but it works in-game so fine by me.
* The mod adds a button in the "shards-menu" of the Icon Kit (GarageLayer) so far.
* Most of the buttons, menus and layers of the mod have an ID.
* Portions of the code are documented, but not all of it.
* Requires "Node-IDs" (v1.12.0 or above).

## To-do list

* Major feature where you can select icons and get an overall amount of mana orbs / diamonds to spend.
* Add a button on the shops of the game.
* Improve the code hundreds of times.
