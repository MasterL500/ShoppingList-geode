# Shopping List

<cr>Note: </c> This mod is under development to add extra features, so it's under "Alpha" phase as we speak.

Displays lists of all the Items you can buy (or have bought) from any of the five available shops in the game. Will soon include a way to calculate how many mana orbs you require to buy icons and more.

## Options (Settings)
